# aduser

Clojure webserver to allow users to reset their password remotely.
Currently uses commons-exec to process a typical windows user reset command. 
This should likely be done away with in favor of an LDAP library.
Secure this by using a reverse proxy with nginx, etc.
Runs standalone with Jetty as an HTTP server
